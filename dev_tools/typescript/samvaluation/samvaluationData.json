Despite having 2 AA Guns post-retrofit, her AA is not enough to solo-carry a fleet; however, it is still above average. Upon retrofit, she gains a special ASW weapon with stats similar to a +10 Hedgehog, which drastically increases her ASW capabilities. Her Skill 1 provides complete immunity for all Vanguard damage taken, although the trigger condition can be hard to satisfy if she is in the center of the Vanguard Fleet. Her retrofit enhances this skill to prevent DoT or other self-damage from happening. The Skill 1 Barrage is also good. Her Skill 2 gives her a barrage whenever the Flagship launches their main weapons, which is aimed and does good damage. Her AoA is improved upon retrofit to also do more damage, which is nice; no AoA reduction hurts though. Overall, she is a great ship."

She has multiple barrages tied to both her guns and skills, giving her great damage variety. The Augment interaction between her and Rikka is not worth using them together for. Overall, she is a great ship."

Her stats are very solid, and coupled with MGM+1 give her good damage output from her Main Guns. Her skills immensely buff the damage potential of all her Auxiliary barrages, and her unique Augment Module adds more barrages to the mix. You want all the Atelier Ryza Bombs equipped on Ryza, due to the +20% crit rate buff to by barrages when equipped by her for applying \"Item Mark\" to enemies, and for the \"Fatal Drive\" unique Augment Module barrage. After all her barrages are exhausted, she is painfully average. Amazing CL for mobbing."

Her skills make her act like a healer, especially for Ryza ships. Her skill and augment barrages add to her damage, but compared to other 8-plane damage-oriented CVs, her damage is lacking due to only having 7-planes. Due to her heal being spread out, and having a pseudo preload (from the barrage activation at the start of the battle), and having better per-strike damage, she is an amazing support. Unicorn Retrofit is better than her regardless. Amazing Healer CVL."

As a solo-CV, her damage is decent, with an 8-plane loadout, barrage on Airstrike, and the damage dealt buffs she gains throughout the battle from skills and Augments. In an Atelier fleet, her 2nd skill can activate way more frequently, and her 3rd skill can grant more AP overall to the fleet, thus increasing her contribution by a fair bit. Inside Atelier fleet: Great CV option. Outside Atelier fleet: Meh CV option."

To gain the most value of her self-buffs, she needs to be sortied in a Senran Kagura fleet. Even outside of a Senran Kagura fleet, she is still good. Her bulk is also fine due to her stats combined with the life-steal from her Skill 2. Overall, she is a great ship."
