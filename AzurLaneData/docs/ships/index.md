# Ship Data

Ship Data represents a singular ship with all of its limit breaks. Every ship contains the following
properties:

## Ship Flags

Ship Flags is a 5-bit bitmask where each bit represents a category a ship can belong to.

| Bit (Mask) |      Label      |                          Description                          |
| :--------: | :-------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------: |
| 0 (1 << 0) |      Bulin      |           A special category for the 3 bulin ships.           |
| 1 (1 << 1) |    Retrofit     |                   The ship has a retrofit.                    |
| 2 (1 << 2) |    Research     | The ship is a research ship, with or without fate simulation. |
| 3 (1 << 3) | Fate Simulation |      The ship is a research ship *with* fate simulation.      |
| 4 (1 << 4) |      META       |                   The ship is a META ship.                    |

### Checking for a Flag

To check whether a ship has a specific flag, use a bitwise AND operation. For example:

```js
if ((ship.flags & (1 << x)) !== 0) {
  // The ship has the flag corresponding to bit x
}
```

## Ship Slot Data

Represents the data for a *single* slot of a ship. Has the following properties:

|    Property    |                       Type                       |                                                                                                                                    Description                                                                                                                                     |

It does not include miltestones, those are in [`PRData`](./research.md#pr-data).<br>For META ships it is also the maximum possible (including milestones), but since META development can be finished at any point it can freely be used at any level. |

## Computing Base Stats

To calculate the ship stats at *any* level you can follow the following:

### Oxygen, Ammo and range_level

These do not scale with level at all and can be used as is.

Currently, no ship with a retrofit adds to these values, that may change.

### All other keys

The formula is as follows: 
$$
  \lfloor (base + \frac{scaling \times (lvl - 1)}{1000} + \frac{extra \times (max(lvl, 100) - 100)}{1000} + strengthen + pr) \times affinity \rfloor
$$.

Where:

- base: The base value provided by `ShipStatsData[key]` (or 0)
- scaling: The scalar value provided by `ShipStatsData.scaling[key]` (or 0)
- extra: The extra scalar provided by `ShipStatsData.scaling_extra[key]` (or 0)
- lvl: The Level of the ship
- strengthen: strengthen values as provided by `ShipStatsData.strengthen[key]`.
    - For non-research non-meta non-research ships this max attainable at level 100.
      - You can compute how much the actual maximum at any given level is using the formula at the end.
    - For PR ships it includes all bonuses up to and including the maximum possible Dev level at that
    limit break (Dev0, Dev10, Dev20, Dev30 respectively). Meaning their numbers may be floats and should
    neither be rounded nor floored and just be used as is.
    - META ship enhancement can be finished at any point so it *can* always be used.
- pr: Any stats gained from PR Dev levels as determined by [`PRData?.stats[key]`](./research.md)
  (or 0).
- affinity: The affinity scalar. This is always fixed at 1 for `spd` and `luck`.

If the ship has a retrofit these values may have to be overwritten. Refer
to [Computing Retrofit Stats](./retrofit.md#computing-retrofit-stats).

If the ship has a fate simulation the stat value
in [`PRData.fate.stats[key]`](./research.md#fate-data) may be added on top of the computed value.

#### Determine Max Strengthen
This section *only* applies to non-meta, non-research ships.

To determine max strengthen value at any given level calculate the following:
$$
  \lfloor (3 + 7 \times (\frac{min(100, lvl)}{100})) \times total \times 0.1 \rfloor
$$

Where `lvl` is the ship level and `total` the value from `ShipStatsData.strengthen[key]`.

## Computing Hunting Range

- First establish the ASR level of the submarine.
- Combine the arrays from `range[0]` to `range[asrLevel - 1]` into a single array (2D ASR Array).
- Create a 7x7 matrix and mark all squares as "unreachable"
- Mark the center of the matrix as "center"
- Iterate the entries of 2D ASR Array:
    - use index 0 as y and index 1 as x offsets
    - Mark the square [3 + y]\[3 + x] as "reachable"
- The result is a 7x7 matrix that represents the hunting range.

## Computing *Final* Stats

Use the following for each ship stat:

- First compute the [base stat](#computing-base-stats) of a ship (\\(BaseStat\\))
- Compute [Meowfficer inheric stat multiplier](../meowfficer/formulas.md#inherit) (\\(CatMultiplier\\))
- Compute flat stat buffs from retrofits, fleet tech and Meowfficer talents (\\(FlatStats\\)).
- Compute \\(FinalScalingStat = (BaseStat \times CatMultipler) + \sum FlatStats\\)
- Compute the percentage stat modifiers from each equipment, ship and Meowfficer skill as well as
  Fleet Formation, Airspace Control and any other applicable buffs \\(SkillBuff\\) and calculate:
  \\(SkillPercentBonus = 1 + \sum SkillBuff\\). Yes, these stack additively.
- Compute the flat stats gained from skills that are straight buffs, stat conversions or augment
  skills (\\(FlatSkillBuff\\)) and calculate \\(SkillFlatStats = \sum FlatSkillBuff \\).
- Compute the final stat as \\((FinalScalingStat \times SkillPercentBonus) + SkillFlatStats\\)

| **maps[n].type**  | `0` \|   `1` |                                     The drop type, 0 means any node and 1 means boss node only.                                     |
|  **maps[n].map**  |   `string`   | The map the ship drops on.<br/>**Important**: Unlike for normal map drops this is the map indentifier and therefor always a string. |
| **maps[n].pity?** |  `boolean`   |                      **(Optional)** Whether the 60x Sortie pity applies to this drop. Treat absent as `false`.                      |

Note: The maps prop of this interface has overlap with MapDrop but due to the type change of the "map" it is documented as on it's own.
