# Intro

This repository contains data that
fuels [Azur Lane Calculator](https://azurlane.mrlar.dev/calculator)
and [Azur Lane Database](https://azurlane.mrlar.dev/db).

Please make sure to read the [License](LICENSE.md) file as well as the [License Section](#license)
before using this data.

# Reason for this Repository

Unlike the actual source of the aforementioned projects, this data may be of use to
others. This repository exists to encourage people to use this data to build
APIs, Applets, Websites or other Azur Lane related programms. While this repository and the
data in it have a clear focus in mind there is no harm in expanding it further
(Just ask if you need something not already covered!).

Additionally, providing this data allows people who spot issues to point them out.
Do note that, opening PRs to fix them usually does not help,
as the data is built using custom parser - which at the moment remain close sourced.

# Documentation

You can find your way around the JSON files using the [documentation](https://azurlane.mrlar.dev/AzurLaneData).

## Barrages

Data for barrages before Feburary 2025 is *partially* derived from previous mining done by Riceist. The original
data can be found [here](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/User:Riceist/BarrageDatamine).

The data found here provides additional info, corrects some oddities and maps barrages by skill ids rather
than ships. Descriptions (especially buff descriptions) have mostly been altered.
